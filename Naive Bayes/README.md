# Naive-Bayes

In machine learning, naïve Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naïve) independence assumptions between the features.

Naive Bayes applied on DonorsChoose Dataset

The ipynb shows the implimentation of Naive Bayes algorithm on DonorsChoose Dataset and how to tune Hyper paramater (alpha) on Smoothing factor in order to get good model.

The data has been prerocessed like removel of duplicate ,stop words, special character and hyper txt links etc

The processed Data have been analysed - univarient analysis to know more about the data .

Metric used tofind best model was AUC (Area under ROC).
